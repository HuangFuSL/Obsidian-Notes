In this exercise, we demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem, where each X is exponential.
1. Generate 1000 random numbers from the exponential distribution with  $\lambda=6$ . and plot them in a histogram. This should give you an idea of what the exponential distribution looks like.
2. For $n=2$ , repeat the following 1000 times: Generate a random sample of $n$ numbers from the exponential distribution with $\lambda=6$ .
3. Compute the sample mean of the $n$ numbers and standardize it using the true mean and standard deviation of the distribution.
4. Make a histogram and normal plot of the 1000 sample means.
5. Repeat (b)-(d) for $n=10, 20$ , and $100$ . Put all four histograms and all four normal plots in the same window. Comment on their shapes.
